 * This class represents a graph of flights and airports along with specific
 * data about those flights. It is recommended to create an airport class and a
 * flight class to represent nodes and edges respectively. There are other ways
 * to accomplish this and you are free to explore those.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Testing will be done with different criteria for the "best" path so be sure
 * to keep all information from the given file. Also, before implementing this
 * class (or any other) draw a diagram of how each class will work in relation
 * to the others. Creating such a diagram will help avoid headache and confusion
 * later.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Be aware also that you are free to add any member variables or methods needed
 * to completed the task at hand
